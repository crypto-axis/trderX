trderX
------
trderX is a "trading toolbox" initially design for Forex lot/risk calculation using API bindings to MetaTrader5.
trderX can now only run under windows, because lack of MT5 API bindings under MAC/Linux.

Actually we have few features:
- Directly connected to your MT5 local instance (Algo trading might be enabled)
- Display the chart from your TradingView account (know issue with TV account registered with gmail) 
- Trade monitoring (edit SL or TP/close)
- Limit/Market order with automatic lot/risk/leverage calculation
- TP/SL value can be fast input from TV copy menu

In the quick future i plan to implement API bindings to crypto exchanges such as:
- Bitmex
- Binance
- Kucoin
- Bitfinex
- Huobi
- etc....

I also plan to add new features like:
- Short timeframe (1s, 5s, 15s, etc) candles directly from exchanges data
- Multiplatform arbitrage functions
- Parallel trades: open same trade on several platforms/exchanges
- Copy Trading client/server
- Money management strategies
- Trade entry/stop customizable strategies
- "Graphical" bot programming
- Backtesting functions (with 1 second candles 2 years ago....)
- Trading bots + copy trading on bots
